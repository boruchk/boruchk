## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a prospective computer engineering graduate, with a robust foundation in embedded systems, eager to apply technical skills to the development of firmware and embedded systems

Here are links to my latest projects. Happy scouting!
- In progress: [Bootcamp web app](https://github.com/DailyCommuter/DailyCommuter)
- In progress: [Senior Design project](https://github.com/boruchk/Tangelo-Magic-Hand)
- Completed: [Webscraper](https://github.com/boruchk/WebScraper) that I used to find occurences of key words in LKML for school/research use
